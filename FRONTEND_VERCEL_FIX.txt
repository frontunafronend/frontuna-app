VERCEL FRONTEND DEPLOYMENT FIX
Timestamp: 2025-08-23T13:20:00Z

ISSUE: Only API was deploying to Vercel, not the frontend
SOLUTION: Modified root vercel.json to build and deploy frontend

CHANGES:
- Root vercel.json now builds frontend (cd frontend && npm run build:prod)
- Output directory points to frontend/dist/frontuna-app/browser
- Added security headers
- This should make frontuna.com serve the Angular app with auth fixes

RESULT: Frontend with auth fixes should now deploy to production!
Admin login: admin@frontuna.com / FrontunaAdmin2024!
