üîê BACKEND SECURITY TRANSFORMATION
==================================

1. DATABASE SCHEMA ENHANCEMENTS (Prisma)
----------------------------------------
Enhanced User Model:
- Added emailVerifiedAt, isActive, firstName, lastName
- Added lastLoginAt, lastLoginIP for tracking
- Added twoFASecret for future 2FA implementation

5. RATE LIMITING & BRUTE FORCE PROTECTION
------------------------------------------
- Progressive backoff on failed login attempts
- IP-based rate limiting
- Account lockout protection
- Audit logging for security events

6. EMAIL SECURITY FLOWS
------------------------
Email Verification:
- One-time hashed tokens (24-hour expiry)
- Secure token generation and validation
- Email templates with professional styling

Password Reset:
- One-time hashed tokens (15-minute expiry)
- Secure reset flow with token validation
- Automatic token cleanup after use

7. AUDIT LOGGING SYSTEM
------------------------
Events Tracked:
- SIGNUP, LOGIN_OK, LOGIN_FAIL
- REFRESH_OK, REFRESH_FAIL, LOGOUT
- VERIFY_REQUEST, VERIFY_OK
- RESET_REQUEST, RESET_OK
- BRUTE_FORCE_DETECTED
- TOKEN_REVOKED, SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY

8. ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION
--------------------------
- Zod schema validation for all environment variables
