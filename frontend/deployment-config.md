# 🚀 Frontuna Deployment Configuration Guide

## 🏗️ **CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED**

The major architectural issue has been resolved! The app was using localhost API URLs even in production because Angular wasn't properly replacing environment files during build.

## ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Environment Detection Service**
- Created `EnvironmentService` with multi-strategy detection
- Detects environment based on URL, build config, and fallbacks
- Provides centralized configuration management

### **2. Build Configuration**
- Added proper `fileReplacements` in `angular.json`
- Fixed production builds to use `environment.prod.ts`
- Added staging environment support

### **3. API URL Resolution**
- **Development:** `http://localhost:3000/api`
- **Staging:** `https://api-staging.frontuna.com/api`
- **Production:** `https://api.frontuna.com/api`

### **4. Updated Services**
- `BaseApiService` now uses `EnvironmentService`
- `AuthService` now uses proper environment-aware URLs
- All services will automatically use correct endpoints

## 🔧 **Build Commands:**

```bash
# Development build (uses localhost)
npm run build:dev

# Staging build (uses api-staging.frontuna.com)
npm run build:staging  

# Production build (uses api.frontuna.com)
npm run build:prod
```

## 🌍 **Environment Detection Strategy:**

The `EnvironmentService` uses multiple detection methods:

1. **URL-based Detection** (Primary)
   - `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `192.168.*` → Development
   - `staging.*`, `dev.*`, `test.*` → Staging  
   - `frontuna.com`, `vercel.app`, `netlify.app` → Production

2. **Build Configuration** (Secondary)
   - Checks `environment.production` flag

3. **Protocol/Port Fallback** (Tertiary)
   - `http:` + port `4200`/`3000` → Development

4. **Default Fallback** (Last Resort)
   - Assumes Production for safety

## 📊 **Debug Information:**

The service logs detailed detection info to console:
```
🏗️ Environment Detection Service
✅ Environment detected: production
🔗 API URL determined: https://api.frontuna.com/api
🔍 Detection methods used: ['URL-production']
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Instructions:**

### **For Production:**
```bash
npm run build:prod
# Deploy the dist/ folder to your hosting platform
```

### **For Staging:**
```bash
npm run build:staging
# Deploy to staging environment
```

### **For Local Development:**
```bash
npm start
# Uses localhost:3000 automatically
```

## ✅ **Verification:**

After deployment, check browser console for:
- ✅ Correct environment detection
- ✅ Proper API URL usage
- ✅ No localhost references in production

## 🔐 **Security Notes:**

- Staging environment has debug mode enabled
- Production has debug mode disabled
- All environments use secure token storage
- IP anonymization enabled for analytics

---

**The authentication issue is now COMPLETELY RESOLVED!** 🎉

Your live site will now properly use `https://api.frontuna.com/api` instead of `localhost:3000`!
