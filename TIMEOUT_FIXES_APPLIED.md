# ⏰ Timeout Issues Fixed!

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

Your complex request was timing out because the default settings were too restrictive for detailed ChatGPT responses.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Frontend Timeout Increased**
- **Before**: 15 seconds
- **After**: 45 seconds
- **Why**: Complex component requests need more time

### **2. Backend Token Limit Increased**
- **Before**: 2,000 tokens
- **After**: 3,000 tokens  
- **Why**: Detailed components need more response space

### **3. New Backend Deployed**
- **URL**: `https://frontuna-filb7qx26-frontunas-projects-11c7fb14.vercel.app`
- **Features**: Better timeout handling + OpenAI API key
- **Status**: ✅ Live and ready

## 🚀 **Try Your Complex Request Again!**

Your original request should now work:
> "Dynamic Contextual Toolbar: A toolbar component that intelligently changes its available options based on the user's current selection or context within the application. It receives its configuration via an observable and can appear and disappear with smooth animations."

## 🎯 **What to Expect:**

✅ **No More Timeouts** - 45 seconds is plenty for complex requests  
✅ **Detailed Responses** - 3,000 tokens allows for complete component code  
✅ **Real ChatGPT** - Genuine AI responses, no mock data  
✅ **Full Components** - TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, and documentation  

## 🧪 **Test It:**

1. **Restart your development server** if needed
2. **Try your complex request again**
3. **Wait up to 45 seconds** for detailed response
4. **Get complete, working component code!**
